== One Key Keyboard ==
This is a keyboard with a single key, powered by the attiny85. Design and instructions on the following blog: http://blog.flipwork.nl/?x=entry:entry081009-142605

=== Install ===
To update the v-usb code, do the following:

- git submodule init
- git submodule update
cd v-usb and follow README.md instructions.

If you are happy enough to use the binaries I've provided in the usbdrv folder you can compile and push a firmware to the attiny85 with: _sudo make program_

I'm using the USBASP ISP programmer, edit the Makefile and change it if you are using something different etc.
